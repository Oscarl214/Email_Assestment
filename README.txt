# Email Development Assessment â€“ README

## Approach & Goals
The goal of this exercise was to create a production-ready, responsive marketing email using the assets provided. My focus was to build a template that:

- Displays consistently across major email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)
- Scales responsively for mobile devices
- Uses email-development best practices, including inline styles and table-based layout
- Ensures accessibility, readability, and brand fidelity

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. **Table-Based Layout**
I used nested `<table>` elements for structure, since this is the most reliable way to achieve consistent layouts across email clients.

### 2. **Inline CSS**
All critical styles were inlined to prevent stripping by Gmail or other ESPs. I used safe properties like `font-size`, `line-height`, and `background-color` for maximum compatibility.

### 3. **Responsive Design**
A simple `@media` query was included to make the template fluid on screens under 600px wide. This ensures mobile users have an optimized experience.

### 4. **Accessibility & Semantics**
- Added `ALT` text for images.
- Maintained high color contrast for readability.
- Used semantic heading hierarchy to support screen readers.

### 5. **Bulletproof CTA Button**
The call-to-action was built using an `<a>` tag styled as a button with inline CSS to ensure it displays as expected across clients, including Outlook.

### 6. **Testing**
I previewed and validated the layout in desktop and mobile environments to ensure spacing, typography, and responsiveness looked correct.

## Notes & Future Considerations
In a real production environment, this email would likely be implemented as part of a modular template system or within a marketing automation platform (e.g., Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Marketo). For scalability, this layout could be converted into reusable components (e.g., React Email, MJML) to streamline future campaign creation.

This approach balances **production-readiness** (HTML/CSS) with **modern development practices** (componentization, reusability) that enable teams to scale their email operations efficiently.
